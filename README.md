# Command line 2fa

# Setup

* replace `jctotp` with whatever your string is named in lastpass in `jc2fa` script
* replace `lastpass@mccroreys.com` with your lastpass username in `getpwd` script
* place both files in `~/bin` and make sure the directory is in your path

# Note:
You will need to use your lastpass password to retrieve the key for the jc2fa script. The session will last for a while,but I generally have to enter my password several times in a day's work.
